        question: "Can I suggest a program/initiative for funding?",
        answer: "For the time being, $TMONK himself will be selecting programs to present to the community for potential funding. However, he knows that no monkey is an island unto himself and that’s why the community will always vote on which initiatives get funding. YOU are the decision maker. If you don’t believe in a project, it doesn’t get funded. Simple as that. But if you do, you’ll stake your coins and meme a difference."
