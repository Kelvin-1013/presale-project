# Proposal for Meme Coin Presale/Launch

## Overview

- **Minting**: Presale coins will be minted and attached to our wallet.

### Tax Structure

- **Transaction Tax**:
  - **1% for Sustainability Initiatives**: Supports carbon credits and clean energy projects.
  - **1% for Liquidity Pool**: Ensures stable trading conditions and price stability.
  - **0-1% for Community Rewards and Development**: Flexible allocation for staking incentives and project development.

- **Staking Reward Tax (0.5-1%)**:
  - **0.5% for DAO Governance Fund**: Supports community-driven governance decisions.

## Sustainability Commitment
1% of each transaction is dedicated to sustainability initiatives, aligning with our mission to promote environmental sustainability.
